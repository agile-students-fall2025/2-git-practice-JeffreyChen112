This article was very interesting because of how relevant it is to our current fiscal policy. Right now, the Fed is in an interesting place where the labor market is weakening but inflation is also rising. The typical response to a weakening labor market is to lower interest rates. However, lowering interest rates will allow infaltion to rise at a greater rate. Therefore, the Fed has to determine which problem has the potential to have the largest adverse effect on the economy. It will be very interesting to see what the Fed does in the coming months. 


Shaurya Srivastava comment - I agree with you, especially with the potential of rate cuts happening in the future, who knows what the labor market could become and how the expectations of rates via Wall street affect business behavior.
